# The audit log bucket.
#
# CloudTrail and AWS Config both deliver here. It is encrypted with a
# customer-managed KMS key, versioned, and locked in COMPLIANCE mode, which
# means no principal in the account -- root included -- can delete or overwrite
# an object before the retention period elapses. That property is the whole
# reason this bucket is separate from the general log bucket.
#
# Written out longhand rather than through terraform-aws-s3 because that module
# owns the bucket policy through its enforce_tls input, and only one
# aws_s3_bucket_policy may exist per bucket. CloudTrail and Config need their
# own statements in that same document.
